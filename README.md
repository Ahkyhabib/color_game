#What is the RGB Color Game?
The RGB Color Game is a game that teaches editors, graphic designers, web designer, programmers, etc., how to use or create unique colors using the red, green, and blue color scheme. 

#What is RGB?
RGB is an [additive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color) [color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model) in which red, green, and blue lights are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. 

When using color codes, they may come in different formats, and two of the main formats are [Hex Codes #RRGGBB](https://www.color-hex.com/), and [Decimal Code rgb(R,G,B)](https://www.mathsisfun.com/hexadecimal-decimal-colors.html). 

With Hex Codes which looks like #rrggbb, hex code byte values range from 00, which is the lowest intensity of a color, to FF which represents the highest intensity. The color white, for example, is made by mixing each of the three primary colors at their full intensity, resulting in the Hex color code of #FFFFFF.

Black, the absence of any color on a screen display, is the complete opposite, with each color displayed at their lowest possible intensity and a Hex color code of #000000.

With Decimal Code there is a range between 0 - 255, for instance, if there is a color such as rgb(255,0,0) the color would be red.  The first number represents the percentage of red, the second number represent the percentage of green, and the third number represents blue 0 being the lesser amount and 255 being the most.

#How dod I come up with this game?
Well... I didn't create this game from scratch.  I actually got this game from a tutorial by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=Colt+Steele) and altered what I wanted too. 
If you would like to see this game made by the originator, you can check him out on [You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrqAGUPPMOdo0jfQ6grikZw).
